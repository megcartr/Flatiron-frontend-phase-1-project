    LET'S MEDITATE! <br>
    Meditation is an important exercise in which benefits your physical, mental, and spiritual well
    being. Close your eyes and focus on inhaling and exhaling equally. For example, inhale for 4 seconds and exhale for 4 seconds. As you
    are breathing, focus on clearing your mind. It will be difficult at first,
    but with practice it will become more natural. Let's begin!
